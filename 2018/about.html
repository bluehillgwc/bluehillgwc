    <h1>About the 2018 Blue Hill Girls Who Code Club</h1>

    <p>Girls Who Code is a nonprofit organization which aims to support and increase the number of woman in computer science. The organization runs programs which teach computing and programming skills to middle and high school girls. This year we have been working on making a site that helps our local non-profit businesses in Blue Hill. We are trying to come up with places people in our community can bring things they don't need or want anymore, or ways they can help or donate to all of the great places in town that we need.</p>
