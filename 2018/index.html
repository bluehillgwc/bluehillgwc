    <h1>
      Clarinet
    </h1>
    
    <h2>Some of my favorite clarinet parts and my experience playing</h2>
  <p>I started playing the clarinet in fourth grade and having now been playing about 6 years. I don't take private lesson and my elementry school music teacher was not very helpful, so I baisically had to teach myself how to play. I was the only person who played clarinet in middle school, and one of two clarinetists currently in my highschool band.

    <h3>
      Jazz Clarinet
    </h3>
    <p>
      I have very little experience playing jazz clarinet because it was disscouraged by my music teachers. Either the pieces didn't have parts for clarinet or they didn't think you would be able to hear it. But the clarinet in jazz is great! And it very much has a place. The clarinet has been key instrument even in the very beginnings of Jazz in the 1910s.

    <h4>
      Here are some great clarinet parts in jazz:
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OcySBum734">Clarinet Solo in Woodchopper's Ball</a></li>
      <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynEOo28lsbc">Rhapsody in Blue</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      Classical Clarinet
    </h3>
    <p>
      I have much more experience playing classical peices because, in my highschool band we play classical pieces for concerts. The clarinet has had a much longer history in orchestra and essembles. I was invented around 1690 and was first appeared in an orchestral peice in 1716.
